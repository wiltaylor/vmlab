# Official vmlab runtime image (PRD §14): the `vmlab` CLI + the `vmlab-web` UI
# server plus their full runtime dependency set. The userspace network fabric
# means the container needs NO --privileged, no extra capabilities, and no host
# network mode — `--device /dev/kvm` is the only host grant needed for
# acceleration (without it, vmlab falls back to TCG with a loud warning).
#
# By default the container runs `vmlab-web` bound to 0.0.0.0:7878 (with
# --no-auth) so the web UI is reachable through a published port with no login.
# Set VMLAB_WEB_USER + VMLAB_WEB_PASSWORD to require a login instead — supplied
# credentials take precedence over --no-auth:
#
#   docker run --rm -p 7878:7878 --device /dev/kvm \
#     -e VMLAB_WEB_USER=admin -e VMLAB_WEB_PASSWORD=secret \
#     -v "$PWD":/lab vmlab
#
# The CLI is still available by overriding the command:
#
#   docker run --rm --device /dev/kvm -v "$PWD":/lab vmlab vmlab up
#   docker exec <container> vmlab status
#
# Build:  docker build -t vmlab -f Containerfile .      (context = this dir)
#    or:  just image      /      docker compose build
#
# WCL + wscript are git dependencies (fetched during the cargo build), so the
# build context is just this repository — no sibling checkouts required.

# The lab's working data (linked disk clones, built ISOs, TPM + lab state) is
# normally written to `<lab>/.vmlab`. With /lab bind-mounted from the host that
# puts heavy, write-churning I/O on the host filesystem — and on Windows that
# bind mount is a slow virtiofs/9p bridge, so disk clones crawl (issue #2).
# VMLAB_WORK_DIR relocates that data onto a container-native volume instead,
# leaving only the editable vmlab.wcl on the (read-mostly) bind mount.
