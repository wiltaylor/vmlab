//! Frozen OCI media / artifact type strings (PRD §6.4, §16 decision #9).

//! Templates distribute as **OCI artifacts, not container images**: the
//! manifest carries a vmlab-specific `artifactType`, the config blob is the
//! template metadata, and the layer blobs are zstd-compressed qcow2 chunks.
//! These strings are part of the on-the-wire contract — once a public push
//! has happened they must not change (§16 #9: "freeze before first public
//! push"). Treat every constant here as immutable.

/// Manifest `artifactType` marking a manifest as a vmlab template. A
/// `docker pull` / `docker run` against such a reference must fail fast as
/// "not a container image"; `vmlab template pull` refuses anything whose
/// `artifactType` is not exactly this string.

/// (the recorded hardware / profile / provenance) serialised as JSON — a

/// representation. We deliberately use `+json` (not `+wcl`) so generic
/// tooling can introspect the config without a WCL parser.
