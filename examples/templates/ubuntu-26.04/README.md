# Ubuntu Server 26.04 LTS template

Builds `x86_64/ubuntu-26.04` into the local template store from the official
Ubuntu **cloud image** + cloud-init (the `ubuntu-24.04` example uses the
subiquity installer ISO instead; this is the simpler cloud-image path).

```sh
vmlab validate
vmlab template build
vmlab template list      # → x86_64/ubuntu-26.04@26.04
```

What happens (`scripts/install.wisp` narrates it in the build log):

1. The build VM boots the cloud image with `cloudinit/` attached as a
   `CIDATA` volume (NoCloud datasource).
2. cloud-init creates user `vmlab` (password `vmlab`, passwordless sudo),
   installs `qemu-guest-agent`, enables it, and disables cloud-init for
   subsequent boots.
3. The script waits for the guest agent to respond and cloud-init to finish.
4. vmlab powers the VM off and seals the disk into the store.

The cloud image under `releases/26.04/release/` is periodically respun, so
its sha256 changes. If the build reports a hash mismatch, refresh `sha256`
from <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/26.04/release/SHA256SUMS>.

The profile is `linux-modern` with `firmware = "seabios"` — cloud images
boot via BIOS.
