# Arch Linux template

Builds `x86_64/arch` into the local template store from the official Arch
**cloud image** (downloaded and sha256-verified automatically). Arch has no
unattended ISO installer, so this uses the cloud image + cloud-init instead
of an installer dance.

```sh
vmlab validate
vmlab template build
vmlab template list      # → x86_64/arch@20260601
```

What happens (`scripts/install.ws` narrates it in the build log):

1. The build VM boots the cloud image with `cloudinit/` attached as a
   `CIDATA` volume (NoCloud datasource).
2. cloud-init creates user `vmlab` (password `vmlab`, passwordless sudo),
   installs `qemu-guest-agent`, enables it, and disables cloud-init for
   subsequent boots.
3. The script waits for the guest agent to respond (proof the install
   landed) and for cloud-init to finish.
4. vmlab powers the VM off and seals the disk into the store.

Arch is a rolling release, so this pins a dated image. To refresh, pick a
newer `vYYYYMMDD.N` directory from
<https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/images/> and update `url`, `sha256` (from
the `.SHA256` beside the image), and `version` in `vmlab.wcl`.

The profile is `linux-modern` with `firmware = "seabios"` — cloud images
boot via BIOS. If a future image is UEFI-only, switch to `firmware =
"ovmf"`.
