# Template build flow

_A build resolves the source, boots a synthesised one-VM lab, runs the provisions, then flattens and seals into the store; a failed build leaves nothing behind._

`vmlab template build` resolves the source (URL downloads are cached and
content-addressed under `~/.cache/vmlab/artefacts/`), creates a working qcow2,
synthesises a one-VM lab from the template definition, boots it per the hardware
profile, runs the provision scripts (full wscript API — keystrokes, screen matching,
exec; the script should install the QEMU guest agent), shuts down gracefully,
flattens and seals into the store. **A failed build leaves nothing behind.** The
sealed result is `~/.local/share/vmlab/templates/<arch>/<name>/<version>/`
(`disk.qcow2` + `template.wcl`). The step-by-step runbook is
