# Vm

_wscript API object_

A VM handle obtained from lab.vm(name): the entry point to lifecycle, snapshots, input, screen matching and the guest agent.

A `Vm` handle is returned by `lab.vm(name)` (or `lab.vms()`). Its methods fall into
five groups, each documented as its own reference:


- [Lifecycle & state](../references/fact_vm_lifecycle.md) — start/stop/restart, state, readiness, IPs.
- [Snapshots](../references/fact_vm_snapshots.md) — take, restore, list and delete snapshots.
- [Keyboard & mouse](../references/fact_vm_input.md) — send keys, type text, move/click/drag the mouse.
- [Screen, image matching & OCR](../references/fact_vm_vision.md) — screenshot, wait-for-image, OCR and text matching.
- [Guest agent](../references/fact_vm_agent.md) — exec commands and copy files in and out.

Fallible calls return `Result[..., string]`; the matched screen hits return a [Match](../references/entity_match_type.md) and exec returns an [ExecResult](../references/entity_exec_result_type.md).
